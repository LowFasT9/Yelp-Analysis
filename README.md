- The whole dataset was filtered and a subset of the original dataset was created consisting of only the business reviews of the restaurants. with Numpy and sklearn libraries, used vectorization and Countvectorizer to parse through the user reviews and made a list of the possible words to search for in the reviews
- Concluding with the pie chart the majority of reviewers had experience with the chicken dishes. This supports the fact that chicken is the most consumed meat in the US which goes up to 8 billion chickens per year. The chart below also adheres to the fact that burgers and pizza are the top two foods ordered in restaurants. The Indian food reviewers are in less proportion than the population in major cities with restaurants in no more than 5% of the city population
